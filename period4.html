			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>South Carolina Post office - burned and stopped antislavery propaganda in the South</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Along with slaves, Native Americans continued to be mistreated by the United States and dealt with many hardships.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (the Prophet)</strong> - Shawnee brother who united the tribes east of the Mississippi River to fight against the US

			<li>Lowell System - factory management that evolved in textile mills

			<ul>
				<li>Also invented interchangeable parts</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Culture also advanced in what can be coined as a <strong class="highlight">Cultural Revolution</strong>. New ideas were proposed by both men and women to change society and its way of thinking.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Second Great Awakening</strong> - upsurge in religious activity that was characterized by emotional revival meetings 
			<ul>
				<li>Stimulated other reforms, such as slavery, temperance,and the women’s movement</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Seneca Falls Convention (1848)</strong> - convention for American women’s rights

			</li>

			<li><strong class="highlight">Cult of domesticity</strong> - belief that a woman’s proper role in life was found in domestic pursuits, like raising children and taking care of the home</li>
		</ul>

		<p><em class="bottom-line">Bottom Line:</em> The presidents who led the nation in its early years impacted the development of it down the road. Political parties came and went with the Democratic-Republicans becoming prominent and the Democrats taking on full speed with President Jackson.</p>

		<p>Manifest Destiny became an extremely important ideal the nation held as it continued with its mission to expand west. This also created problems as the expansion of land led to the question of whether or not new states should allow slavery. This problem is discussed in the next period.</p>

		<p>The United States is in full swing as a functioning nation with its domestic economic problems and foreign wars. It continues to grow as a nation under the Industrial Revolution and takes a step away from a rural agricultural society.</p>
