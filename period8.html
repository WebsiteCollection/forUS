		<p class="open-p">Period 8 takes on the events that occurred after the World Wars and leads into the Cold War. Other important events such as the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam War are covered and show the growing power of the United States. (AP: This is 15% of your exam, another big part of the exam so make sure to study!)</p>

		<p>Let’s begin with the end of World War II. The conflicts with Germany and Japan dwindled down. Now the war lies between the superpowers of the world: the United States and the USSR.</p> 

		<p>The United States prospered from the war and it brought the nation out of the Great Depression.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">GI Bill of Rights 1954</strong> - provided veterans with pensions, government loans, and money to attend college
			<ul>
				<li>Helped promote economic prosperity</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>National Defense Student Loans 1958 - loans established to encourage the teaching of science and modern foreign languages
			<ul>
				<li>Passed in response to the launch of Sputnik</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Sun Belt</strong> - region stretching from Florida in an arc across the South and Southwest that saw population growth and industrialization</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Baby boom</strong> - increase in the birth rate that lasted until 1964</li>
		</ul>

		<p>After World War II and the invention of nuclear warfare, the USSR decided to develop their own to rival the US. Tension grew as the two superpowers grew in status, thus beginning the <strong class="highlight">Cold War (1945 - 1991)</strong>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Not an actual war, just a bunch of tension (both political and economic) between the US and Soviet Union</li>
			<li>Iron Curtain - introduced by Winston Churchill to describe the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Foreign policies remained a big part during this era as the US had to deal with the rise in nuclear warfare and the effects of World War II.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Truman Doctrine 1947</strong> - President Harry Truman’s policy of providing economic and military aid to any country threatened by communism</li>

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Detente</strong> - President Nixon’s policy of relaxing tension between the US and Soviet Union; he visited both the Soviet Union and China to smooth the tension</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Nixon Doctrine</strong> - President Nixon’s policy of requiring countries threatened by communism to assume most of their military burden, with the US offering political and economic support</li>
			<li>Space Race
			<ul>

				<li>Apollo 11 - first spaceflight that landed humans on the moon by the Americans in 1969</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Nuclear Arms Race
			<ul>
				<li>Hydrogen bomb 1952 - first hydrogen bomb, which was 1000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb

				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Containment of communism
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="highlight">Vietnam War 1954-1975</strong> - after French colonists were forced out of Vietnam, it was divided into 2 nations
				<ul>
					<li>The North communist regime ultimately attacked the South and tried to take over</li>
					<li>Increased involvement of American troops</li> 
					<li>The war ended with the victory of the North, so both fell under communism</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong class="highlight">Tet Offensive 1968</strong> - Vietcong (Vietnamese communist rebel in South Vietnam) and North Vietnamese attack throughout South Vietnam that caused public opinion in the US to turn against the war</li>
					<li><strong class="highlight">My Lai 1968</strong> - Village in South Vietnam where US troops massacred 350-500 innocent women and children
					<ul>
						<li>Increased public opposition of the war</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong class="highlight">Vietnamization</strong> - President Nixon’s policy of gradually removing US troops in the Vietnam War
					<ul>

			</ul>
			</li>

			<ul>

			<li><strong class="highlight">Tonkin Gulf resolution 1964</strong> - After President Johnson claimed North Vietnamese forces attacked US boats in the Gulf of Tonkin, Congress basically gave the president a “blank check” to do whatever necessary to stop communism</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">War Powers Act 1973</strong> - law that prevented the president from involving the US troops into wars without congressional authorization; mandated the president to give 48 hour notice of using a troop and cannot be more than 60 days</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The rise in communism led to many Americans becoming afraid of radicalism and communist regimes. The <strong class="highlight">Red Scare</strong> began as the United States became increasingly wary.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)</strong> - congressional committee created in 1938 that began investigating suspected communists right after WWII</li>
			<li>Alger Hiss - Former State Department official who was convicted of supplying information to the Soviets
			<ul>
				<li>Discovered by the House Un-American Activities Committee in Congress</li>

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>National Security Act 1947 - reorganized the military under one Department of Defense and established the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The Vietnam War caused quite a stir in America as many were against such violence, especially when there were domestic issues that plagued the nation.</p>
		<ul> 
			<li><strong class="highlight">Students for a Democratic Society 1960</strong> - left-wing student organization founded to attack Americans materialism and work for social justice and civil rights</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Associated with the Anti-War Movement in the late 1960s</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Pentagon Papers 1971 - classified government documents on the Vietnam War were leaked to the New York Times by Daniel Ellsberg</li>
		</ul> 

		<p>The Cold War extended to include <strong class="highlight">Latin America</strong>, where the US tried to keep communism regimes out (which ended up straining the relationship between the two).</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Organization of American States 1948</strong> - organization composed of most of the nations of North America, South America and the Caribbean
			<ul>
				<li>Designed to fight communism in the western hemisphere</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Bay of Pigs 1961</strong> - invasion of communist-controlled Cuba by Cuban exiles who were supported by the CIA

			</ul>
			</li>

			<li><strong class="highlight">Fidel Castro</strong> - dictator who took control of Cuba and ruled it as a communist regime</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Seems like the United States couldn’t keep itself from getting involved in pretty much every area of the world. Problems also came up in the <strong class="highlight">Middle East</strong> as the United States increased its involvement and also had a bad desire for oil.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Suez Crisis 1956</strong> - confrontation between Egypt on one side and Britain, France, and Israel on the other side after Egypt tried to nationalize the Suez Canal

			<ul>

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)</strong> - economic alliance of oil-producing countries, mostly Arab, that became powerful enough in the 1970s to control oil prices by controlling oil supplies

				<li>US was hard hit as oil prices went up</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Camp David Accords 1979</strong> - treaty between Israel and Egypt that was negotiated by President Carter
			<ul>
				<li>Under the treaty, Israel would return occupied Egyptian land and Egypt would recognize Israel as a nation</li>

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Carter Doctrine 1979 - policy that the US would use force to repel any nation that attempted to take control of the Persian Gulf
			<ul>
				<li>Was passed in response to the USSR invasion of Afghanistan</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There’s a hefty load of foreign problems for the United States, but it also has its fair share of domestic issues too. The 1960s became a period for fighting against oppression of minority rights and a rise in liberalism to promote equality. The <strong class="highlight">Civil Rights Movement</strong> consisted of civil rights activists who utilized a variety of strategies (legal challenges, direct action, nonviolent protests, etc.) to combat racial discrimination.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Rosa Parks</strong> - African American who refused to give up her seat for a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama
			<ul>
				<li>Helped start the boycott of buses</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="highlight">Southern Christian Leadership Conference 1957</strong> - became the backbone of the movement to achieve civil rights through acts of nonviolence</li>

			</li>
			<li>Freedom Summer 1964 - effort by civil rights groups in Mississippi to register black voters</li> 
			<li><strong class="highlight">Brown v. Board of Education 1954</strong> - pivotal case that overturned the “separate but equal” idea from Plessy v. Ferguson - <a class="caselink" href="cases.html#brown" target="_blank">see cases page</a></li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Little Rock Nine</strong> - 9 black students were not welcomed to go to high school that was to be desegregated

			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Title VII - provision that guarantees women legal protection against discrimination</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Voting Rights Act of 1965</strong> - law that banned unjust restriction on voting and authorized federal supervision of elections in areas where black voting had been restricted</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The movement for equality wasn’t entirely violence-free. The <strong class="highlight">Black Power Movement</strong> rejected nonviolent acts and preferred to use violence to get their point across.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Watts 1965 - neighborhood in Los Angeles, California where race riots broke out
			<ul>
				<li>Resulted in millions of dollars of damage and 28 deaths</li>

		<ul>
			<li>American GI Forum 1948 - organization formed by Mexican American veterans to fight against discrimination and provide support for veterans and Hispanics

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Equal Rights Amendment 1972</strong> - amendment that would give women equal rights under the law

			<ul>
				<li>Was occupied by AIM in 1973 and they insisted that the government honor the treaty from the past</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The rise in liberalism didn’t end at the promotion of minority rights. The people urged the government to help out in the times after the war.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Great Society 1964</strong> - social program by President Johnson to fight the war on poverty, protect civil rights, and fund education</li>
			<li>War on Poverty 1964 - program to help Americans leave poverty through education, job training, and community development</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Medicaid 1965</strong> - health insurance program for the poor and provides states with money to buy health care for people on welfare</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Medicare 1965</strong> - health insurance program for the elderly and disabled and provides government payment for health care by private doctors and hospitals</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong class="highlight">Radicalism</strong> also played a role during this area as some claimed that there wasn’t enough being done to transform the racial and economic status of the United States.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Students for a Democratic Society</li>
			<li>Berkeley Free Speech Movement 1964-65 - student groups that insisted on their right to political activity on campus</li>
		</ul>

		<p>American society was transforming during the 60s as young people began to reject social, political, and economic values of the previous generation and started a sexual revolution and state of informality.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Counterculture</strong> - rejected the competitiveness and materialism of America and wanted peace, love, and freedom instead

			<ul>
				<li>Ideas were showcased in their works</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here’s a quick plug about immigration as the laws changed once again after World War II!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Immigration and Nationality Act 1965</strong> - abolished the national origins quota system (put in place in 1924) and gave preference to skilled workers</li>
		</ul>

		<p>America also focused on the environment! Industrialization created problems and people were becoming increasingly aware of them.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Silent Spring 1962</strong> - book by Rachel Carson that warned of the misuse of pesticides and their negative effects on the environment
			<ul>
				<li>Credited with starting the modern environmental movement</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Earth Day, April 22, 1970 - international day to celebrate and be aware of the global environmental issues</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1970</strong> - Federal agency created to control pollution and protect the environment (as the name would suggest)
			<ul>
				<li>If this sounds familiar, you’ve probably heard quite a bit about it from the news and how funds may be cut</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Clean Air Act 1970</strong> - federal law designed to control air pollution</li>
			<li>Three Mile Island 1970 - site of a nuclear power accident in Pennsylvania
			<ul>
				<li>Led to radioactive gases and almost created a nuclear meltdown</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A period in American history would not be complete without some problems in domestic politics! There were arguments and polarization over social issues that put a divide between conservatives and liberals.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>New Right - conservative movement that was against liberal political and social reforms in the 1960s
			<ul>
				<li>Wanted less government intervention and a return to traditional values</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Watergate Scandal 1972</strong> - scandal in the Nixon administration that began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters
			<ul>
				<li>President Nixon tried to cover up the incident and a whole case expanded on his knowledge of the incident and whether he knew of it or not</li>
				<li><strong class="highlight">U.S v. Nixon</strong> - <a class="caselink" href="cases.html#nixon" target="_blank">see cases page</a></li>
				<li>This led to Nixon’s resignation in 1974</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Abortion became a touchy subject
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="highlight">Roe v. Wade 1973</strong> - ruled that women have the right to choose abortion - <a class="caselink" href="cases.html#roe" target="_blank">see cases page</a></li>
				<li>Right-to-Life Movement - anti-abortion movement</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Phyllis Schlafly - New Right activist who protested against the women’s rights movement
			<ul>
				<li>Opposed the Equal Rights Amendment</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p><em class="bottom-line">Bottom Line:</em> It seems to be one war after another in the 20th century. The United States has successfully come out of World War II as a recognized superpower, but their growth only created conflicts with the rest of the world.</p>

		<p>Domestic issues also plagued America as people pushed for equal rights that were not available to them. Some fights were won, but that shouldn’t be the extent to which progress is made.</p>
		
		<p>Liberalism rose in the 1950s and 60s, ushering in social change, but this didn’t last very long.</p>

		<p>Conflicts with the world continued and conservatism began to take rise towards the 1980s.</p>
